# PhysicsSim
A physics simulator giving info about force, energy, momentum, etc. Two available modes: a ball rolling down a ramp or a mass on the end of a spring. Coded in Java in collaboration with Lucas Webb.

## Available Variables
Note: all variables can be plotted on either the X or the Y axis.

### Spring:
- Potential Energy
- Kinetic Energy
- Acceleration
- Time
- Velocity
- Compression
- Force

Spring constant, damping, and starting position of the mass can also be adjusted.

### Ramp:
- Potential Energy
- Kinetic Energy
- Distance Travelled
- Time
- Velocity
- X Position
- Y Position

Incline angle of the ramp can also be adjusted.
