PhysicsSim

    Our project will be a physics simulator. The simulator will consist of a collection of smaller “mini-simulations” such
as ball on ramp, pendulum, and spring.  Each object will have a list of attributes, such as potential energy, kinetic
energy, speed, direction, etc. that the user can access.  Ramps may be given different kinetic and static friction
coefficients for example.  If we have time, we will make different attributes of the objects can be graphed against each
other or against time.  Collisions will be head-on only. Our data type will be a linked list that stores all the
objects in the simulator. We chose a linked list because it is efficient for removing objects, if a user wants to get
rid of something they created, and it is just as fast as an array for adding objects. We will most likely never need to
search the list - all we need to do is iterate through all the elements every tick and add their current velocity to
their current position and update their other attributes.

Our timeline is:
By the end of this week, we would like to have the creation of the ‘physics’ object classes completed with logic.
Over the weekend, we will implement the GUI.
Next week, we will add functions to graph data collected from the objects in the simulation.
Thursday, we will be doing final testing and hand it in.
